# TwitterStream

The aim of this project is to stream tweets related to a keyword or a hashtag. 
In each search top tweets are taken from [twitter mobile site](https://mobile.twitter.com/),
then live streaming is automatically updated as new tweets arrive.

To make this application work, [ConstantValues class](https://github.com/blediboss/TwitterStream/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/bledi/android/Utilities/ConstantValues.java) should be modified accordingly.

Here's what it looks like:
